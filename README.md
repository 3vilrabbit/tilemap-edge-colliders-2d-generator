# TileMap EdgeColliders2D Generator
A simple script to automatically generate Edge Colliders 2D on top of platforms created with TileMap.

## How to use it
* Add the TileMapEdgeColliders2DGenerator script to your desired TileMap grid (e.g. the one containing one-way platforms). The script needs a TilemapCollider2D and a CompositeCollider2D to work.

* Press the "Generate EdgeCollider2D" button to run the script. All previously generated Edge Colliders are removed before generating the new ones.

*NOTE: You can use the "Remove all EdgeCollider2D" button to remove them all (e.g. if you want to switch back to using the CompositeCollider2D).*
